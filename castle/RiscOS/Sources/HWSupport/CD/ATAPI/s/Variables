; Description
; ===========
; Workspace layout.

; Change record
; =============
; 14-Mar-95  15:14  cpartington (Cambridge Systems Design)
; * Removed redundant variables ModeLength, ModePtr, ColourBuffer, DumpArea,
;   TransferStart, TransferEnd.
; * Added call to macro AlignSpace to ensure that DriveMapList is
;   word-aligned (as MEW's comment says it needs to be).
; * Added DriveFlags.
; * Removed GeneralConfiguration (unused).
;
; 06-Apr-95  17:45  cpartington (Cambridge Systems Design)
; * Added debugging variable 'inbytes'.
;
; 12-Apr-95  10:02  cpartington (Cambridge Systems Design)
; * Added debugging variable 'sense_buffer' and moved 'inbytes'.
