1.MDF based scheme
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
OS: Doesn't support EDID, configured with MonitorType Auto

Monitor is?      Plugged in?  Outcome?                                                  Recovery story?
----------       ----------   -------                                                   --------------
Same model       Yes          Good image (most common situation)                        -
as earlier       No           No image                                                  -
                 No but later Good image (LoadModeFile loaded the MDF regardless)       -
                 reconnected                                                            
Different model  Yes          Only a good image if earlier MDF works on new monitor     Blind type *WimpMode, then run !Configure to choose new model
than before      No           No image                                                  -
                 No but later Only a good image if earlier MDF works on new monitor     Blind type *WimpMode, then run !Configure to choose new model
                 reconnected

2.EDID based scheme
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
OS: Does support EDID, has !Boot on read/write medium, EDID monitor was selected in !ScrnSetup

Monitor is?      Plugged in?  Outcome?                                                  Recovery story?
----------       ----------   -------                                                   --------------
Same model       Yes          Early boot uses CMOS MonitorType until monitor choices    -
as earlier                    obey file reached => good image (most common situation)
                 No           No image                                                  -
                 No but later Only a good image if OS's default mode (SVGA?) supported  Blind type *LoadModeFile
                 reconnected                                                            or reboot
Different model  Yes          Early boot uses CMOS MonitorType until monitor choices    -
than before                   obey file reached => good image (read from new monitor)
                 No           No image                                                  -
                 No but later Only a good image if OS's default mode (SVGA?) supported  Blind type *LoadModeFile
                 reconnected                                                            or reboot

3.EDID based scheme softloaded on top of MDF only ROM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
OS: Initial boot from old OS, as early as OS 3.50, softload does support EDID and was selected in !ScrnSetup 

Monitor is?      Plugged in?  Outcome?                                                  Recovery story?
----------       ----------   -------                                                   --------------
Same model       Yes          Early boot uses Auto until softload starts then good      -
as earlier                    image (most common situation); if softload is not         
                              selected, loads MDF and behaves per scenario 1            
                 No           No image
                 No but later Only a good image if OS's default mode (SVGA?) supported  Blind type *LoadModeFile
                 reconnected                                                            or reboot
Different model  Yes          Early boot uses Auto until softload starts then good      -
than before                   image (read from new monitor)                             
                 No           No image                                                  -
                 No but later Only a good image if OS's default mode (SVGA?) supported  Blind type *LoadModeFile
                 reconnected                                                            or reboot

4.EDID based scheme discless boot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
OS: Does support EDID, no disc, or failed !Boot, configured MonitorType is EDID

Monitor is?      Plugged in?  Outcome?                                                  Recovery story?
----------       ----------   -------                                                   --------------
Same model       Yes          Preferred mode chosen (most common situation)             -
as earlier       No           No image                                                  -
                 No but later Only a good image if OS's default mode (SVGA?) supported  Blind type *LoadModeFile
                 reconnected                                                            or reboot
Different model  Yes          Preferred mode chosen (read from new monitor)             -
than before      No           No image                                                  -
                 No but later Only a good image if OS's default mode (SVGA?) supported  Blind type *LoadModeFile
                 reconnected                                                            or reboot

Notes
~~~~~
Monitors are required to return EDID data if connected in, even if not turned on - the EDID memory is powered by
the motherboard. Therefore, the above tables only consider the connected/not connected possibilities since the
monitor being off or on isn't important.

Tables assume hotplug is not supported by the hardware, let alone the software, and that EDID data from the
monitor is truthful. Hotplug support in a later version will remove all requirements to recover a bad mode choice
by blind typing when the monitor is plugged in after booting, presently a reboot is required.
