         *      Bit 1 set: Don't allow downloading -- substitute a default font instead.
         *                 This only applies if bit 2 is clear (permanent download) and
         *                 does not affect remappings -- only full downloads.  The default
         *                 font is hardwired into the code (DEFAULTFONT).

         *      Bit 2 set: this is a transient download (inside print job) and an Acorn
         *                 encoding may be sent/referenced.  The font might have kerning info,
         *                 and its name will be prefixed RO_ or RK_.  If this bit is clear,
         *                 then the font is being downloaded permanently, without an encoding and
         *                 with a name prefix of DL_.  In this case the font should get

         *                 print with it.  Unless you are providing an exitserver wrapper
         *                 in the calling code, this bit should be SET.

         *      Bit 3 set: try to provide kerning info.  No effect if bit 2 is clear.

         *      Bit 4 set: Do remaps with RF and RFE procedures (which should be predefined
         *                 in the preceding PostScript prologue).  This mechanism is provided
         *                 so that the remapping system can be altered by editing the prologue
         *                 file.  RF takes three parameters:
         *                      newname matrix oldname RF
         *                 RFE takes four parameters:
         *                      newname encoding matrix oldname RFE
         *                 In both cases matrix may be 'false' meaning don't alter the
         *                 parent font's matrix.  If a matrix is specified it should be
         *                 concatenated with the parent font's matrix.  For RFE, encoding
         *                 may be 'false' meaning use the parent font's encoding.
         *                 The matrix may be 'false' which means don't apply a matrix.
         *
         *                 If this bit is not set, then a short PostScript remap sequence is
         *                 sent instead, which does not rely on prologue support.  If you are
         *                 doing permanent downloading (bit 2 clear) then you should set this bit).
         *

         *      All other bits reserved and should be zero.

         * RETURNS:
         * V SET:  R0 points to error block
         * V CLEAR: if R3 is zero, the (R2) contains the zero-terminated
         *          font name to reference this font with.
         *          If R3 is non-zero, then the return name buffer overflowed.
         *          Allocate a buffer at least R3 bytes long, and call
         *          again to obtain the font name.  (NB: the output has
         *          already been sent; the second call just gets you
         *          the fontname).

         * Output to the file handle supplied (which is still open)
