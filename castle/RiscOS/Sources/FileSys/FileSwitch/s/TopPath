; These routines are the top level routines for manipulating file paths.
; They provide packaged complex path manipulations with checks for the
; kind of uses paths have:
;
; * To construct a path for OPENs for fsinfo_alwaysopen filing systems
;
; * To access a file for reading only (OPENIN, *Load, OS_File read attributes etc)
;
; * To access an existing file for update (OPENUP, OS_File change attributes etc)
;
; * To access a file which may or may not exist for creation/OPENOUT (rename too).

; All-singing, all-dancing do everything to a path to end up at an object. This
; gets to MultiFS directories from the underneath - it isn't too useful for

;               1       If an FS is fsinfo_alwaysopen then return immediately.
;               2       Return error if path strings or vars used are multi-element or
;                       if the leaf name is wildcarded. Used for OPENOUT/*create/*save
;                       style operations.
;               3       If found a directory, then extend with '.!Run', and treat as does
;                       not exist if that doesn't exist.
;               4       Don't object to a nul filename even if the FS doesn't have
;                       fsinfo_nullnameok set.
;               5       Don't try to ensure the object exists except when necessary.
;                       Necessary is resolving wildcards / deciding which path element
;                       applies - that sort of thing.
;                       This means that the object's info will be invalid - only
;                       the path parts may be relied upon, and those are only reliable
;                       for reconstructing paths.

;               7       For EnsureThingIsDirectory. This causes entry into a partition

; MB Fix (10/3/99)
; original code allocated a minimum of 16 bytes for the translated path
; then didn't check for overwritting the end that's clearly very dumb...
; In low stack situations a no stack error is infinately preferable to
; stack corruption. The lack of length check is still there, but most of the
; OS will die if any path exceeds StaticName_Length.
; original code:
;        GetLumpOfStack  r5, #16, #StaticName_length, #2048, %F90

        GetLumpOfStack  r5, #StaticName_length, #StaticName_length, #2048, %F90
