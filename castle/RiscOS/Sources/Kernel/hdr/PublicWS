; Memory map values: (in address order)

; Legacy kernel locations (ZeroPage-relative)
 
; Note - the addresses defined here are what were used with the RISC OS 5.22-era
; kernel and may not match the addresses in use by any newer kernel which your
; code may be running on. If you need to peek at these values then make sure
; you look up the address at runtime using OS_ReadSysInfo 6, and only fall back
; to these definitions if the OS_ReadSysInfo implementation doesn't recognise
; the item.
