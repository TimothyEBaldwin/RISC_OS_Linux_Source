# Makefile for Autobuild
#
# This component should be placed into (any type of) builds as the final component
# so that it can perform any final installation tasks, such as copying files
# into archives, adding pre-built binaries, etc.
#
# If we're not running in an autobuild environment (i.e. AutoBuild$Build & AutoBuild$Root
# are unset) then this component will not do anything.
