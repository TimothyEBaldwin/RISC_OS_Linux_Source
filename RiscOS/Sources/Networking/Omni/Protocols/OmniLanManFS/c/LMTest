 This demonstates the use of the two SWIs provided by LanManFS v1.68,
 LanMan_NameOp and LanMan_Transact. These are as follows:
*/
#define LanMan_SWI_base         (XOS_Bit|0x49240)
#define SWI_LanMan_NameOp   (LanMan_SWI_base + 2)
#define SWI_LanMan_Transact (LanMan_SWI_base + 3)

/*
* LanMan_NameOp is used for retrieving the names of machines and other
*  items on the network. It is called with:
*
* R0 = reason code, 0-3
* R1 = pointer to name in, or NULL (use depends on reason code)
* R2 = pointer to a 16-byte buffer which is to receive the name
*   returned from the call. Network names are up to 15 characters,
*   (generally in upper-case, although no LanManFS calls are case
*   sensitive), plus a terminating zero.
*
* If there is no error, all registers are unchanged. Else, V is set
*  and R0 points to an error block.
*
* The reason codes are as follows:
*
* R0 = 0: Get local machine name
*   R1 is ignored. The network name of this machine is copied to the
*   buffer at R2.
*
* R0 = 1: Get logged-on workgroup/domain name
*   R1 is ignored. The name of the workgroup or domain which was set
*   with the *LMLOGON command is copied to the buffer at R2.
*
* R0 = 2: Get master browser for workgroup
*   R1 is the address of a ASCIIZ string containing a workgroup name.
*   The master browser for that workgroup (a server which maintains
*   an up-to-date list of all the other servers in the group) is
*   located, and its name is copied to the buffer at R2. If R1 is NULL
*   on entry, the currently selected workgroup name (as set with *LMLogon)
*   is used. You can use this call to find the name of a server from which
*   to get lists of other servers.
*
* R0 = 3: Get domain controller
*   R1 is the address of a ASCIIZ string containing a domain name.
*   The domain controller for that domain is located, and its name is
*   copied to the buffer at R2. If R1 is NULL on entry, the currently
*   selected workgroup or domain name (as set with *LMLogon) is used.
*
* If the master browser or domain controller can't be found, the error
* 'Can't find given server' is returned.

/*
*  LanMan_Transact
*
*  This is used to execute remote-procedure-calls on a network server.
*  Typically, the server will be able to perform all the calls in
*  the Microsoft's Lan Manager Programmer's Reference via this mechanism.
*  Although MS document the C interface to these calls, they do not
*  make available information as to how the calls are converted to
*  the network parameter format used by the Transact call. Thus, a
*  certain amount of analysis of network packets and other black arts
*  is required.
*
*  Anyway, all calls made via the Transact interface send information
*  to the server at the start of the call, and retrieve information back
*  afterwards. The information sent and returned is divided into
*  Parameters (typically 16 or 32-bit integer values) and Data (typically
*  structures, strings, etc) - exactly what each of these are varies from
*  call to call and is sometimes A Mystery. Making a call consists of
*  assembling the parameters and data into a buffer, then setting up a
*  structure containing the addresses and lengths of these, together with
*  addresses and lengths for where to put the results.
*
*  The parameters to LanMan_Transact are as follows:
*
*  R0 = ASCIIZ name of server on which to make the call (this is not
*        case sensitive; only the first 15 characters of this name are
*	 significant).
*
*  R1 = Transaction name (identifies the process on the server which is
*     	 servicing the call). For Lan Manager API transactions, this
*	 should point to the ASCIIZ string "\PIPE\LANMAN".
*
*  R2 = Pointer to parameters-and-results structure. This is a 10-word
*     	  structure as follows:
*
* [R2+0]: Length of parameters to be sent to server
* [R2+4]: Address of parameters to be sent to server
* [R2+8]: Length of data to be sent to server
* [R2+12]: Address of data to be sent to server
*
* [R2+16]: Maximum length of parameters to be returned from server
* [R2+20]: Address of buffer to receive returned parameters
* [R2+24]: this will be filled in (by LanMan_Transact) with the actual
*            length of parameters returned from the server.

* [R2+28]: Maximum length of data to be returned from server
* [R2+32]: Address of buffer to receive returned data
* [R2+36]: actual length of data returned from the server (filled in by
*             LanMan_Transact).
*
* Note that the 'returned' parameters and data can occupy the same
*  memory buffer as the 'sent' ones, if required. If any 'length'
*  field is zero, its associated pointer need not be defined.
*
* The SWI may return a variety of errors. In particular, if LanManFS
*   is not currently connected to the given server, it will have to
*   establish a connection using the user ID and password set with
*   *LMLogon. If these are not valid, you may get an 'Access denied'
*   error.
