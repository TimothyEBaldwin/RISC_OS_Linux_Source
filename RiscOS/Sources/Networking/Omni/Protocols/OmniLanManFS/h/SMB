/*
   CreateShare() is a monster routine to cope with everything
     related to connecting to the server. The main input variables
     are server name, share name and user name; CreateShare will
     attempt to create a share matching all of these parameters, doing
     all the necessary jiggering to make it work. The precise actions
     depend on whether these strings are the same as or different to
     previous values:

     Server Name -

     if a new server name, a new connection to the server will be
       created, the given user will be logged on & the given share
       will be connected. If any of this fails, the connections are
       closed.

     if the same as a server which is already connected:
       i ) if the user name is different to the user currently logged
            on at the server, the current user is logged off and the
            new one is logged on. This will only happen if CREATE_NEW_
            USER is set in the 'style' parameter, otherwise the user
            name is ignored.

       ii) if the share name is a different to any currently connected
            shares on the server, a new 'drive letter' is allocated
            and the new share is connected. If the CREATE_NEW_SHARE
            bit is set and the share name *isn't* new, the error
            ECONNEXISTS will be returned and *share_lettr_out will
            be set to the drive letter of this drive.

       if an error occurs during (i), we've lost the connection to
       the server and all other shares on the server will give
       failure errors when we try to use them. If an error occurs
       during ii), the new share is not created and an error is
       returned.

   The user name and password may optionally be NULL. If the user name
     is blank (NULL pointer, null string or white space), the re-logon
     process in (i) above will not happen, equivalent to CREATE_NEW_USER
     being clear. If a new server is being connected, and both the
     user name and password fields are blank, the user name and password
     fields are taken from LM_Vars. This might theoretically create a
     problem if a server insists on both these fields being blank, but
     in practice NT won't put up with blank user names and WFWG can't be
     made to insist on a blank password.
