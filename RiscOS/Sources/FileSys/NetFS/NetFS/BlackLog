Change Log:
===========

Version 5.48

  *  *Access @ doesn't give a "Not found" error (bug 1004).
  *  Not listening in enumerate doesn't give "Station 3.254 not listening"
     when the net number is not 3 (bug 1313).
  *  *Free :<non-existent-file-server> doesn't give the "Station not known"
     error (bug 1324).
  *  Enumeration and cataloging can cope with file servers, like the Vax,
     which have more than 256 entries in a directory (bug 1494).
  *  Date conversion SWI upgraded and fixed (bug 1597).
  *  Caches the right number of discs, eight, in the FSList (bug 2041).
  *  *Mount/*Sdisc call NetFiler to update server icon name (bug 2043).
  *  Interfaces that accept memory addresses now validate all buffers before
     using them (bug 2054).
  *  FSInfo word now shows number of files openable, five (bug 2055).
  *  Searching for named file server now more enthusiastic (bug 2056).
  *  SWI NetFS_ReadFSName uses R2 correctly (bug 2057).
  *  Network errors from BroadcastForNames now reported by FillCache (bug 2058).
  *  Help and Syntax messages for the two configuration commands are now
     tokenised (bug 2069).
  *  *CDir & is now a null operation (bug 2076).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 5.49

  *  July and August now have 31 not 29 days, this cures the "Bad date" errors
     during *Ex, *Info, and *FileInfo (bug 2089).
  *  Improved error messages from internal routine "FindNamedContext", it now
     says "Not logged on" when it finds the name in the cache (bug 2099).
  *  Improved *ShutDown algorithm, copes better with "Who are you?" errors
     from the file server (bug 2102).
  *  Added a new SWI for updating the cache, it is used by NetFiler (version
     0.21 and greater) to ensure the cache is up-to-date (bug 2086).
  *  Better wording of error message when structures are inconsistent, it used
     to be "HelpHelp", it is now "Fatal internal error" (bug 2081).
  *  *Dir/*Lib call NetFiler to update server icon name (bug 1158).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 5.50

  *  Two new interfaces added to help support desktop shutdown and state
     saving. These provide access to the name used to logon to a file
     server.  The first gives the logon name of the current file server, the
     second allows enumeration of non current file server contexts to return
     the logon name as well as the file server name.  The output of *FS<CR>
     has been changed to include the logon name.

  *  A new low level interface has been added to the filing system to allow
     FileSwitch to perform a CLOSE#0 operation to all file servers, this
     will be provoked by the closure of the last file.

  *  OS_File 5, "&", returns errors correctly. (bug 2107).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 5.51

  *  Changes made to the code that opens files to cope better with SJ file
     servers.  They allow files to be w/w, something Acorn's don't, and the
     main problem was that NetFS relied upon an undocumented feature of the
     Acorn file server that was not supported by SJ, they now do support it
     and NetFS doesn't rely on it.  Both bases covered.  Also allowed files
     with access bits of "d/r" and "d/wr" to be opened as if they were "r/". 
     SJ use these two types for their "/prt" and "/spl" file types.  This
     change allows them to be *Dumped and/or *Typed.  (Bug 2144)

  *  Allowed the operation of OPENIN to work on "&" by catching the null
     case properly.  (Bug 2147)

  *  Added a new user interface SWI NetFS_GetObjectUID, this call takes a
     file name in R1, and the special field in R6, and returns like OS_File
     (5) except that a 64 bit UID is returned in R0+R7.  There is also a new
     service call NetFSDying which is issued before NetFS removes itself
     from FileSwitch.  Both these new features were added to aid the
     BroadcastLoader.

  *  Changed code that supports closing of the last file on a file server so
     that rather than it being done externally, it is now done by the NetFS
     code itself.  When a file is closed the list of all open objects is
     scanned for any open files on the server in question if there aren't
     any, then a CLOSE#0 will be issued.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 5.52

  *  Fixed a fault in *Rename where NetFS completely ignored the special
     field of the second argument, this meant that attempts to move files
     from one file server to another with the new Filer_Action module would
     end up renaming onto the source file server.  NetFS now checks that
     both special fields evaluate to the same file server, if they don't
     then it returns the error "Bad rename (&000105B0).  It also now checks
     that the special field is not null and if it is treats this the same as
     if the pointer was zero.  (Bug 2168, 2171)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.53 Wed 24-Oct-90        Bruce Cockburn

  *  Fixed problem in *Shutdown where it could return a bad error pointer,
     it also now reports any errors by writing to OS_WriteC the error string
     eg.  "Warning: Station 49.253 Not listening".

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.54 Thu 25-Oct-90        Bruce Cockburn                

  *  Corrected internal return value within the internal routine GetBytes.

  *  Added a new SWI (NetFS_EnableCache) this will re-enable the cache
     receive block so that file servers can reply with their disc names and
     have their replies processed.  This should be called after calling the
     SWI which enumerate the cache, because the enumeration SWI disables the
     cache receive block so that the contents of the cache doesn't change
     during a single enumeration.  This is particularly important for the
     manager program associated with the Level 4 File Server.

  *  Added an extra bit in the fsinfoword in support of new and upcoming
     FileSwitch modules i.e. fsinfo_handlesurdetc.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.56 Sat 08-Dec-90        Bruce Cockburn                

  *  Corrected code in the SWI routine for getting the UID of an object,
     now that there exists a file server that supports the new interface
     (Function code 18, Reason code 7).  It now returns the file server
     station number, filing system and drive number correctly.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.57 Wed 17-Apr-91        Bruce Cockburn                

  *  Internationalised.

  *  MultiFS extensions.

  *  No longer claims port &99.

  *  Changed the SWI NetFS_GetObjectUID to return the object type and as a
     result the UID is now in different registers.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.59 Wed 01-May-91        Bruce Cockburn                

  *  Fixed Help file so that is is tokenised correctly, broken recently by
     changing "=" to "DCB", *Tokenize only accepts the former.

  *  Fixed bug in *Logon caused by new semantics of errors conflicting with
     previous cleverness in overlaying two buffers, vis the password buffer
     and the error buffer.  The fix is to allocate the two buffers
     separately.

  *  Changed SWI NetFS_GetUID so that SJ file servers always return the not
     supported error if they fail on ReadObjectInfo (7) since they can
     return an unexpected "Not found" error if allowed to continue with the
     *Info call.  This is provoked by getting the UID of a file in the
     library, without explicit reference to the fact that it is in the
     library.  SJ servers do automatic library searching, but not on *Info.

  *  Fixed a bug in *FS caused by internationalisation that got a return
     condition wrong, and failed to print a newline in the listing.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.60 Mon 01-Jul-91        Jonathan Roach / Bruce Cockburn               

  *  General fixes to do with interactions between NetFS and FileSwitch and
        other areas of the system:
              * *FS, *Logon, *Mount and *SDisc all do a *Net:NoDir. This
                means the #<FS>::<Disc> map to the relevant thing, and the
                current directory defaults to &, as required.
              * *Bye issues a Service_DiscDismounted - this triggers
                directory unsetting and viewer closing automagically.
              * fsfunc_CanonicaliseSpecialAndDisc sorted out to canonicalise
                to the form Net#<disc>:<path without disc>.

  * Fixed all places where the names of the discs on the current server are
    enumerated to try more than once to get all the names.  This was
    prompted by bug reports from SJ which after consultation were traced to
    the fact that the SJ server can only return a small number of disc names
    at once.  Also changed the background caching of disc names to transmit
    a request for more names if it thinks there may be more (this is a bit
    of a bodge in that it decides that if four names are sent then there may
    be more.  This is tuned to the case of the SJ server).

  * There is a distinct version of 5.60 which we had to make by poking the
    binary of 5.59, it has a fixed fsinfo word to declare the right number
    of files open at one time (5 not 0).  The help string says "NetFS 5.60
    (11 Nov 1991) (2.00)".

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.61 Mon 08-Jul-91        Bruce Cockburn                

  *  Changed the canonical form to Net::<name> so that internal processing
     of canonical forms is easier (because the required form (to send to the
     file server) is always a substring of the canonical form).  Changed
     interfaces (Enumerate, *Access, *Rename, ReadBoot, WriteBoot *Dir,
     *Lib, OS_File, OS_Find, & FS_Function) to support only the new
     canonical form for file names.

  *  Fixed a bug which prevented NoClock errors from being reported in
     ListFS and probably also in Logon.  Bug RO-6605.

  *  Fixed a bug in the selection of the current file server (*FS) that
     allowed the current file server to appear twice in the list of file
     servers.  Bug RO-6650.

  *  *Bye changed to make sure that the context doesn't remain if an error
     occurs.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.62 Wed 10-Jul-91        Bruce Cockburn                

  *  Fixed OS_File load and SWI NetFS_GetUID to work with canonicalised file
     names.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.63 Mon 22-Jul-91        Bruce Cockburn                

  *  Fixed OS_File Load so that if the open fails the load command gets the
     right (processed) filename, this prevents the spurious Bad name error. 
     Bug RO-6870.

  *  Fixed both Logon and Bye so that they dismount all discs.  This is done
     in the common routine PurgeForTemporaryFileServer, it now enumerates
     the discs (from the name cache) and sends a Service_DismountDisc for
     each one.  Bug RO-6922.

  *  Fixed OS_File Load so it doesn't return Bad name.  Bug RO-6870.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.64 Tue 27-Aug-91        Bruce Cockburn                

  *  Fixed OS_File Save so it doesn't return Bad name when asked to save
     more than 64k of data.

  *  Only on the RISC OS 3.00 version.  Changed *Logon and *Mount to compute
     the library pathname and then set this in FileSwitch using SetDir.  The
     library handle is then closed.  The character % is no longer accepted
     as a valid pseudo directory name.

  *  Changed the way the Current and Temporary file server context is held
     so that the static storage overhead is less, and so that the
     requirements of the newer (RISC OS 3.00) directory and library
     interfaces could be more easily supported.

  *  Changed the two loops that wait for replies from a broadcast for names
     so that they now change into user mode and call SWIs, this allows
     callbacks to work during the waiting period.

  *  Resumed the code for doing *Cat and *Ex so that they now go faster. 
     Small tweeks to make the format identical to that used by FileSwitch.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.65 Fri 30-Aug-91        Bruce Cockburn                

  *  Various fixes related to enumeration, namelookup, ESCape handling *FS,
     *Logon and *Bye.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.66 Wed 11-Sep-91        Bruce Cockburn                

  *  Bugs fixed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.67 Thu 12-Sep-91        Bruce Cockburn                

  *  Bugs in context selection (internal) and *FS fixed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.68 Thu 12-Sep-91        Bruce Cockburn                

  *  Found (and fixed) the Heap corruption bug, also fixed a bug in
     cataloging, and installed the code to unsure that the three context
     handles are "correct" i.e. reflect the current settings of "@" and "%".

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.69 Wed 18-Sep-91        Bruce Cockburn

  *  Fixed bugs in context management, and list following.

  *  Fixed fsinfo word to declare the right number of files open at one time
     (5 not 0).  See also 5.60

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Released in ROM as RISC OS 3.00

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.70 Mon 23-Dec-91        Bruce Cockburn                

  *  Changed the names of the unused SWIs.  Bug RP-0158.

  *  Fixed the formatting of *Ex.  Bug RO-9896.

  *  Stored Threshold and Block values derived from ReadTransportType into
     the context record, and use then in LOAD and SAVE.

  *  Added code to abandon the open receive block used for file server name
     resolution (the name cache) when asked by the service call
     Portable_Control Tidy.  This allows Econet to power down.

  *  Fix bug in CreateNumberedContext that gave BadStation errors in Logon.
     Bug RO-9323.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.71 Wed 05-Feb-92        Bruce Cockburn                

  *  Added new command *AddFS.  Mostly to help the Multi Network System
     project.  Syntax and help as follows;

     HelpForStarAddFS
           *AddFS adds the given file server and disc name to those NetFS
           currently knows about.  If only the station number is given then
           that station will be removed from the list of known file servers.
     SyntaxOfStarAddFS
           Syntax: *AddFS <station number> [<disc number> [:]<disc name>]

  *  Used routine needed by *AddFS to validate the file server disc name to
     validate input to the SWI NetFS_SetFSName (and hence *FS), to *Mount
     (and hence *SDisc), *Bye, *Logon.

  *  Fixed a bug in *Free where it didn't process *Free :49.254 fred
     correctly, it used to treat "49.254" as the name rather than the number
     of the file server.  Also added name validation.

  *  Fixed bug on DoFSOp where it would give an address exception if used
     without being logged on.

  *  Fixed bug in ListFS that opened RxCBs with station 0.0 rather than
     255.255.

  *  Changed the boot command format from "Net:%<command> !ArmBoot" to
     "%<command> Net:!ArmBoot" so that the Run$Path will be used so that
     boot files can reside in the library.

  *  Added a -force option to *ListFS so that the cache is flushed first,
     causing it to be explicitly re-filled before being printed out.

  *  Added code to use the CSD and LIB handles to act as a cache of
     evaluated path names.  All object names are now compared with these two
     handle names and if a leading sub-string is found a shorter command to
     the file server results.  The cache values are set either by a *Rename
     where path length reduction is important (because there are two) and by
     the first call to any enumeration.

  *  Removed the local error buffer and used the new SWI in MessageTrans
     CopyError to make errors from the file server longer lasting.

  *  Added code to use the Territory_UpperCaseTable to do all case
     insensitive matching (names entering the cache, looking up disc names,
     *Rename, and cache handle technology).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.72 Thu 27-Feb-92        Bruce Cockburn                

  *  Added code to Delete and Rename so that the object which might cease to
     exist is not held as a cached path (by caching "&" instead).

  *  Fixed *SDisc and *Mount so that they close the right handles and set
     variables correctly.  Bugs RP-0864 and RP-0707.

  *  Fixed *FileInfo so that it works.  Changed it to only do a *Info (to
     the actual file server) for each file.  Bug RO-9772.

  *  Changed the Service_EconetDying code to Flush the name cache.

  *  Fixed FSFunc_CanonicaliseSpecialAndDisc to return the error "Not logged
     on" if appropriate.  Bug RO-9326.  Also did the cross reference between
     the disc name and the special field, this has a new error "Disc ê%0ë
     not known on file server ê%1ë".  Code now also checks the userid (if
     supplied) and can return the new error "Not logged on to ê%0ë as ê%1ë".

  *  Fixed ShutDown so it doesn't send *Bye to file servers it is not logged
     on to.  Bug RP-1455.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.73 Fri 13-Mar-92        Bruce Cockburn                

  *  Changed message file handling to only open on demand.  Bug RP-1619.

  *  Fixed a bug in the 2.00 version so that Open '$' works.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.74 Mon 16-Mar-92        Bruce Cockburn                

  *  Fixed a message lookup bugs introduced in 5.73.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.75 Tue 07-Apr-92        Bruce Cockburn                

  *  Fixed a bug in *Logon; it wasn't opening the new (ArthurLib) library
     correctly yet was associating the name with the LibraryHandle thereby
     causing the path cache machinery to get confused.

  *  Fixed a bug in the name resolution that caused Bad Port errors in the
     server.  Bug RP-1916.

  *  Fixed a bug that caused canonicalised names to refer to the wrong drive.

  *  Changed Save, Create, EXT#=, PTR#=, and EnsureSize to all fault lengths
     over &00FFFFFF.

  *  Fixed Open to return the allocated size.

  *  Fixed EnsureSize to return the new size.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.76 Fri 10-Apr-92        Bruce Cockburn                

  *  Fixed a bug introduced in Open, it got the size right but the extent
     was always three.

  *  Changed the Threshold and Block value calculations to read the
     PacketSize from the transport.  Block=10*PacketSize, Threshold=5*Block.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.77 Fri 10-Apr-92        Bruce Cockburn                

  *  Fixed a bug in Block and Threshold calculation code.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.78 Fri 24-Apr-92        Bruce Cockburn                

  *  Removed code to release port &99.

  *  Recoded the SetEXT code to break large changes up into many small
     changes, this prevents large calls to SetEXT from timing out.  The
     threshold value is set to &20000 and the block size to &10000.  These
     values are arrived at by timing the operation on a FileStore writing to
     a floppy disc, they give about 20 and 10 seconds respectively.  When
     the operation is broken up it also twirls the hourglass percentage
     figure so the user can judge progress.  Bug RP-2323.

  *  Added code to *Free to use the internationalisation formatting
     information provided by the Territory module to do the formatting of
     the decimal value.

  *  Changed *Free to not send the disc name to the file server padded out
     with more CRs than the one required.

  *  Fixed a problem with *Free introduced in 5.60.  Some FileStores have a
     bug whereby they send the same drive info more than once so *Free now
     keeps a check on the returned drives and gives up if it gets an entire
     packet it has had before.

  *  Fixed a bug in the canonicaliser that meant the Net: would cause an
     exception.

  *  Changed logon so that maintenance mode file servers are given the name
     !<stationnumber> and their logon name is properly recorded.

  *  Separated out the OS 2.00 and OS 3.00 switches from those to do with
     using MessageTrans and ResourceFS, to help make a 2.00 version that
     does use MessageTrans (for A.U.N.).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Released in ROM as RISC OS 3.10

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.79 Wed 02-Dec-92        Bruce Cockburn                

  *  Changed the disc name cache insertion code to only have one of
     each name, the one with the highest net and station number.

  *  Fixed a bug in Logon that returned the address of a Context block
     as an error when creating a numbered context.  This caused a
     funny error.  Bug RP-2933.

  *  Fixed bug, token LogOff was capitalised wrongly in the *Bye
     command leading to token not found errors when warnings about
     errors during logoff are translated.

  *  Fixed a bug in SetEXT that caused the extent to be set to values under
     the true extent; thus trashing the end of the file with zeros.  The bug
     was introduced in 5.77 in an attempt to fix bug RP-2323.  The fixed
     code now gets the current extent from the server before making any
     changes to the file.

  *  Fixed return value of R0 in ReadUserId to be entry value of R1.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.80 Sat 17-Jul-93        Bruce Cockburn                

  *  Fixed Shutdwn and LogOff messages (reversed "'" and ":").

  *  Fixed *Rename bug that translated *Rename &.a.abug &.abug into *Dir &.a
     *Rename abug ug.  It was caused by the leading-substring matcher not
     stepping backwards properly such that it terminated on the "." between
     "a" and "abug".  Bug reported by Stephen Lawrence of SJ.

  *  Changed close so that instead of doing a CLOSE#0 after closing the last
     file it does it instead of closing the last file, which results in one
     less command to the file server.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.81 Thu 26-Aug-93        Owen Love

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.82 Mon 27-Sep-93        Bruce Cockburn                

  *  Fixed internationalisation of help and syntax messages.  Code changes
     for the introduction of the above undocumented but known to have been
     made by Edward Nevill.

  *  Moved help and syntax messages into the local message file.

  *  Tweaked syntax messages to tokenise better.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.83 Thu 14-Oct-93        Bruce Cockburn                

  *  Fixed bug in OS_File_ReadCat that corrupted low memory (by erroneously

Change Log:
===========


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.83 Wed 22-Jun-94        Aideen McConville             

Moved to new source tree.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.84 Wed 06-Apr-94        Bruce Cockburn                

  *  Changed Warning messages so that new format errors are more syntacticly
     correct as inclusions.

  *  Changed length of broadcast for names to only be the required seven
     bytes rather than the buffer size of eight.  Problem noted by Richard
     Crook of SJ Research.

  *  Fixed bug in AnotherTx routines that caused the port to go wrong. 
     Bug reported by Richard Crook of SJ Research.

  *  Fixed a bug that caused *ListFS -force to ask for the wrong starting
     point in an enumeration if an enumeration had happened before.  The
     state associated with an enumeration was hanging around for too long. 
     This was fixed by flushing the AnotherTx list whenever the broadcast
     for names happens.  Bug reported by Richard Crook of SJ Research.

  *  Fixed a bug in open that caused the FCB list to loop (because a block
     was deallocated but not removed from the data structure) if errors are
     returned from the subsequent operation after an open but before control
     is returned to FileSwitch.  Bug reported by Richard Crook of SJ
     Research.

  *  Added an extra issuing of the service call NetFS just before doing the
     Logon boot action in case the OSCLI doesn't return (because it is an
     application).  This means that the NetFiler will get the file server
     name right.  Found by Carl Sellers and Jonathan Roach.

AMcC: 24-Jun-94:

Needs version 3.52 of HdrSrc (includes updated Macros).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.85 Thu 08-Sep-94        Steve Cormie                  

* Fixed MED-03705: "Unset" now comes from Global.Messages file.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.86 Mon 31-Oct-94        Steve Cormie                  

* Added directed comments to Messages file for message tokenisation.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.87 Thu 19-Jan-95        Steve Cormie                  

* Fixed MED-04369: Prevented token 0 substitution for *configure output help
  messages.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.88 Tue 07-Feb-95        Steve Cormie                  

* Fixed MED-03569: Now handles FSEntry_Args 8 (write zeroes) but only if the
  block of zeroes is at the end of the file (set extent is used to force the
  file server to write zeroes).

  Changed files: s.Random

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.89 Tue 28-Feb-95        Christopher Partington

Fixed MED-04780: reverse one of the changes made for 5.84. Always broadcast
for disc names with an eight-byte broadcast packet, even though only seven
bytes of content is significant. This is because old machines, e.g. Level
III fileservers, only accept exactly 8 byte broadcasts.

Files changed: s.Commands
               Time+Date

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 5.90 Tue 07-Mar-95        Alan Glover                   

Fixed MED-01949: Increase buffer size to quote with long path names. Then
adjust various sources to change ADRs to ADRLs...
