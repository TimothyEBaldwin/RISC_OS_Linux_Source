#! perl
# Simple perl program to read the localedata, mnemonic and character
# map to produce an ordered list of all the characters
#
# Source for the files processed by this program can be found in gnulibc
# and ftp://dkuug.dk/i18n/WG15-collection
#
# WARNING: This utility will not run with RISC OS Perl. It's faster under
#          unix, too. This version is intended to be run on a Unix system,
#          or with unix filename translations.
# 
# The program will ONLY produce a collated list of the characters defined
# in the input file. It will not generate any other information from it.
#
# Syntax: 
#   makesorted <inputfile> <charset> <outputfile>
#
# <inputfile> is a file like es_ES which contains the collating order
#             and structuring of the character set.
# <charset> is a character set description, listing the characters that
#           exist in a characters set in the mnemonic form.
# <outputfile> is a file to write the ordered output into. This will be
#              a file of ~256 characters which can be passed to
#              SortValues to produce the source to insert into the
#              territory.
#
# Procedure for generating a new territory with a collation order :
#
# 1. Obtain generic territory file from gnu libc or the above site.
# 2. Copy the relevant entries from the LC_NUMERIC, LC_MONETARY and
#    LC_TIME sections. If translations are available from external
#    sources trust them over those in the file.
# 3. Ensure that a relevant character set exists for this territory
#    ISO-8859-1Acorn should suffice for most, but you may have to
#    modify this to contain by the variant you require.
#    Modification of this file will need reference to the actual
#    characters used in the character set and mnemonic for the
#    mnemonic descriptions.
# 4. Run Makesorted over the files, eg :
#      makesorted es_ES ISO-8859-1Acorn Spain > dump
# 5. Check the output file to see that it contains a character set that
#    looks like that which you expect. The dump file may contain more
#    information about the ordering of the characters.
# 6. Copy this file into the SortValues directory and run Conv over it.
#    This will tell you which characters are missing from the character
#    set.
# 7. Modify the language file to add any characters which are described
#    in mnemonic and that are absent from the description file.
#    Write an annotation in the language file to describe the changes you
#    made. Go to 4 and repeat until you're happy that you've removed most
#    of the faults.
# 8. Manually add any characters that are missing to the output file
#    before running it through Conv one last time. You will probably have
#    to add characters 83, 84 and 87 at this point (these are undefined
#    characters which will probably not exist in the language file).
#    Once you've got it right, Conv should give no errors.
# 9. Copy Source to the end of the territory source file.
