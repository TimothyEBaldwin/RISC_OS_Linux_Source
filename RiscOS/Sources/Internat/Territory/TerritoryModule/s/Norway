ToControlTable

; OSmith 29-Apr-92 This table is wrong on Perth, since it is defined as
; being the value of the character if it is typed with the CTRL key held
; down. Thus the table should be held in the keyboard driver module not
; here, and switching keyboards would then need to send round
; Service_TerritoryStarted.

; Personally I think this table is daft and shouldn't exist at all. If
; anyone reading this knows of a good reason why we need this table, then
; please add it to these comments and EMail me.
;
; KBracey 12-Sep-98 Corrected for PC (Perth) layout - it may be daft
; but it might as well be right :)

; Note that this sort order is not used directly - first the string is
; collapsed via ToPlainTable+ToLowerTable and sorted according to this
; order. If still equal, it's collapsed via just ToLowerTable and checked again.
; If still equal, the string is finally compared directly.
;
; Thus strings are first sorted by letters, then accents, then case, in
; the order given by this table. Callers to Territory_Collate have the option
; to ignore accents/case.
;
; If you want an accented letter to be sorted as a letter in its own right,
; such as n-tilde in Spanish, then ToPlain(n-tilde) should = n-tilde.
; If this isn't acceptable, then define a separate ToPlainForCollate table -
; this might be necessary for funny sorting of u-diaeresis with y in
; Scandinavian territories: ToPlain(u-diaerisis)=u, ToPlainForCollate(u-diaeresis)=y.
;
; fi and fl ligatures are specially treated to sort equal to separate fi
; and fl.
;
; In the Norweigan territory, AA=≈, ö=OE, ﬁ=TH, ƒ sorts as an accented ∆, ÷ sorts as
; an accented ÿ, – sorts as an accented D.
