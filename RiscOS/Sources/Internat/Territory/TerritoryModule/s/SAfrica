; Note that this sort order is not used directly - first the string is
; collapsed via ToPlainTable+ToLowerTable and sorted according to this
; order. If still equal, it's collapsed via just ToLowerTable and checked again.
; If still equal, the string is finally compared directly.
;
; Thus strings are first sorted by letters, then accents, then case, in
; the order given by this table. Callers to Territory_Collate have the option
; to ignore accents/case.
;
; If you want an accented letter to be sorted as a letter in its own right,
; such as n-tilde in Spanish, then ToPlain(n-tilde) should = n-tilde.
; If this isn't acceptable, then define a separate ToPlainForCollate table -
; this might be necessary for funny sorting of u-diaeresis with y in
; Scandinavian territories: ToPlain(u-diaerisis)=u, ToPlainForCollate(u-diaeresis)=y.
;
; fi and fl ligatures are specially treated to sort equal to separate fi
; and fl.
