/* ---------------------------- heap_init ----------------------------------
 * Description:   Initialises the heap allocation system.
 *
 * Parameters:    BOOL heap_shrink -- if TRUE, the flex block will be shrunk
 *                                    when possible after heap_free()
 * Returns:       void.
 * Other Info:    You must call flex_init before calling this routine.

/* ---------------------------- heap_alloc ---------------------------------
 * Description:   Allocates a block of storage from the heap.
 *
 * Parameters:    unsigned int size -- size of block to be allocated
 * Returns:       pointer to allocated block (or 0 if failed).
 * Other Info:    This uses the flex module to allocate wimp-supplied heap
 *                space. If the heap moves as the result of an extension
 *                or flex can't extend the heap then 0 is returned.

 * Description:   Free previously allocated block of heap storage.
 *
 * Parameters:    void *heapptr -- pointer to block to be freed
 * Returns:       possible error condition.
 * Other Info:    none.
