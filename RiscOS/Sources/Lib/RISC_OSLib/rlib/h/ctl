 *                      undefined actions.
 *
 * Returns:     void.
 *
 *
 * Other Info:  This function should be called once before any other

 *
 *              It should be called with TRUE for development work,
 *              as it allows you to have undefined actions in the Control
 *              file. For a working program, this should be called with
 *              FALSE, then all actions should be defined, and then the
 *              Control file should be loaded using ctl_load(),
 *              this enables the ctl module to do syntax checking when the
 *              application starts and produce errors if there are
 *              undefined actions in the Control file.
 *
 *              You must call:
 *                  wimpt_init(),

 * Other Info:  If ctl_init() was called with FALSE, this function should
 *              be called after all actions have been defined. This will
 *              load the Control file, and produce FATAL errors if there
 *              are any undefined actions in the file.
 *
 *              It should be called ONCE after all actions have been
 *              defined but before any other function in this module.

 *                           actions in this window.
 *
 * Returns:     TRUE if able to attach menu.

 *                       function.
 *
 * Returns:    void.
 *
 * Other Info: 1. Actions are global to the application.
