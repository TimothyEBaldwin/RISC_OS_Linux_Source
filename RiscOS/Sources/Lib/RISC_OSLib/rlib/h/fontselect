/* --------------------------- fontselect_selector -----------------------------
 * Description:   Opens up or reopens the font chooser window.
 *
 * Parameters:    char *title                -- The title for the window (can be NULL if flags SETTITLE is clear)
 *                int flags                  -- The flags for the call (see below)
 *                char *font_name            -- The font name to set the window contents to (only if SETFONT is set)
 *                double width               -- The width in point size of the font
 *                double height              --
 *                fontselect_fn unknown_icon --
 * Returns:       The window handle of the font selector main window, if the function
 *                call was successful. Otherwise it returns 0.
 * Other Info:    The flags word allows the call to have different effects.
 *                    If fontselect_SETFONT is set then the window contents wil be updated to reflect the font choice passed in
 *                    If fontselect_SETTITLE is set then the title of the window will be set, otherwise title is ignored.
 *                    If fontselect_REOPEN is set then the font selector will only open the window if it is already open. This
 *                      lets the application update the contents of the window only if it is currently open.
 *                Note that the fontselect_init() must be called before this routine.
