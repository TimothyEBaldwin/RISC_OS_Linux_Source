    *       (00-99).

    * %t is replaced by a horizontal-tab character.
    * %T is equivalent to "%H:%M:%S" (the ISO 8601 time format).

    *       Monday is 1.
    * %U is replaced by the week number of the year (Sunday as the first day of
    *       week 1) as a decimal number (00-53).
    * %V is replaced by the ISO 8601 week number as a decimal number (01-53).
    * %w is replaced by the weekday as a decimal number (0(Sunday) - 6).
    * %W is replaced by the week number of the year (Monday as the first day of
    *       week 1) as a decimal number (00-53).
    * %x is replaced by the locale's appropriate date representation.
    * %X is replaced by the locale's appropriate time representation.
    * %y is replaced by the year without century as a decimal number (00-99).
    * %Y is replaced by the year with century as a decimal number.
    * %z is replaced by the offset from UTC in the ISO 8601 format ("-0430"),
            or by no characters if no time zone is determinable.
    * %Z is replaced by the timezone name or abbreviation, or by no characters
    *       if no time zone is determinable.
    * %% is replaced by %.
    * If a directive is not one of the above, the behaviour is undefined.
    * Returns: If the total number of resulting characters including the
    *          terminating null character is not more than maxsize, the
    *          strftime function returns the number of characters placed into
    *          the array pointed to by s not including the terminating null
    *          character. otherwise, zero is returned and the contents of the
