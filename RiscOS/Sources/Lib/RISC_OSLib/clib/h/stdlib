 * Multibyte Character Functions.
 * The behaviour of the multibyte character functions is affected by the
 * LC_CTYPE category of the current locale. For a state-dependent encoding,
 * each function is placed into its initial state by a call for which its
 * character pointer argument, s, is a null pointer. Subsequent calls with s
 * as other than a null pointer cause the internal state of the function to be
 * altered as necessary. A call with s as a null pointer causes these functions
 * to return a nonzero value if encodings have state dependency, and a zero
 * otherwise. After the LC_CTYPE category is changed, the shift state of these
 * functions is indeterminate.
