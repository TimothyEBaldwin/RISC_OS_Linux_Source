		Trace
		



Introduction
˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜

This is a simple library that can hack the executable at runtime,
intercepting all functions that have embedded function names (see cc
-fn). There is also (not very well tested) support for intercepting the
execution of individual instructions.

Functions can be intercepted individually, or Trace can be told to
intercept all functions except those that match a list of wild-carded
function names.



Tracing program execution
˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜

By default, Trace outputs information to stderr whenever a function is
entered or exited. Functions are provided to instead call a
user-provided function instead.

Example output:

Trace:   1  | Desk_Error2_Init_JumpSig
Trace:   2  | | Desk_Error2_HandleAllSignals
Trace:   2  | |~Desk_Error2_HandleAllSignals
Trace:   1  |~Desk_Error2_Init_JumpSig
Trace:   1  | FileDbox__MakeList
Trace:   2  | | Desk_Error2_Init_JumpSig
Trace:   3  | | | Desk_Error2_HandleAllSignals
Trace:   3  | | |~Desk_Error2_HandleAllSignals
Trace:   2  | |~Desk_Error2_Init_JumpSig
Trace:   2  | | scrolllist_delete_items
Trace:   3  | | | Desk_Debug_Printf
Trace:   4  | | | | Desk_Debug__LineNestingPrefix
Trace:   4  | | | |~Desk_Debug__LineNestingPrefix

etc etc.



Checking for APCS compliance
˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜

The function Trace_APCSCheck_Init (in 'Trace.APCSCheck.h') uses
Trace_SetHandlers() to make the trace library call special functions on
function entry/exit which check that the intercepted function obeys RISC
OS's varient of APCS - ie preserves r4-r11,r13 and the processor flags
in bits 0-1,25-31 of r15.

Note that checking of APCS compliance and tracing of program execution
cannot both occur at the same - currently the trace library only allows
one set of function enter/exit handlers to be registered.





Diagnosing stack usage
˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜

The functions Trace_Stacker_StartHandler() and
Trace_Stacker_StopHandler() (in 'Trace.Stacker.h') can be registered
with Trace_SetHandlers(), and will provide information on the stack
usage of functions at runtime.

To add stack diagnostics to your own program, do the following:

	
	Compile all functions with 'cc -fn -DTrace_TRACE' to force
	function names to be embedded in the generated code and
	enable Trace library functions.
	
	Add the following to the start of the file containing main():
		#include "Trace.Trace.h"
		#include "Trace.Stacker.h"
	
	Add the following lines to the start of main():
		Trace_SetHandlers( Trace_Stacker_StartHandler, Trace_Stacker_StopHandler);
		Trace_InterceptAllFunctions();
	
	Link with 'C:Trace.o.T_PL'.

See 'Trace.Test.Stacker' for an example of this.

By default, stack diagnostics will be sent to stderr. You can change
this using the function Trace_Stacker_SetOutputFunction().

The two functions Trace_Stacker_Max_StartHandler and
Trace_Stacker_Max_StopHandler are similar, except that they only output
diagnostics when a new maximum amount of stack is used.




Linking
˜˜˜˜˜˜˜

You should link with 'C:Trace.o.T_PL'.

Trace.o.T_PL is a self-contained library (partially linked with some of
my other libraries, then libfiled). 

Trace.o.T needs linking with some of my own libraries. 

Trace.o.*_UL are compiled with UnixLib headers.

Trace.o.*_M* are for use in C modules.

Trace.o.*_D* output diagnostics to stderr.




Other things
˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜

One problem that could possibly occur is that somewhere in your
programs's code area there is a sequence of static data which looks like
an embedded function name. Embedded function names are marked in
compiled code by a word after the embedded name which is 0xffxxxxxx,
where xxxxxx is the length of the name (this corresponds to a SWINV
instruction, so one can find embedded names in Zap by searching for
SWINV or looking for '*** use of NV').

Trace will ignore embedded names which claim to be more than 255
characters long, so the only danger is if you have some static data that
contains a word matching 0xff0000xx.




History
˜˜˜˜˜˜˜

27 Jan 1997
Outputs diagnostics to stderr instead of stdout (see
Trace_SetVerboseLevel()).

28 Jan 1997
Made all of |C$code| areas readonly - assembler fragment used to be
read/write.


11 Mar 1997

Added fixes due to Ben Laughton for two obscure bugs which break Trace
when running in modules:
	
	s.veneer was previously in the |C$code|,CODE,READONLY, but contained
	data. In module code, code and data are accessed differently, which
	messed things up. Not too sure of the details here, but making the 
	veneer CODE and DATA seems to fix it.
	
	To call intercepted function foo and return back to trace, was using
	ADR lr, return: B foo. However, when foo does MOVS pc, lr, it will
	change into USR mode because the lowest two bits of lr will be 0. 
	Fixed this so that lr contains the current mode in the bottom two
	bits.

Also changed s.AddVen to be CODE+DATA



14 Mar 1997

Added APCS-checking.



01 Apr 1997

The UnixLib build allows sl (r10) to be changed over a function call -
with a contiguous stack sl doesn't have to be restored.



03 Jun 1997

Added Stacker functions.




10 Jul 1997

Added Trace_SetPrintfFn, to redirect the default output to a function
instead of stderr.



30 Jul 1997

Hopefully stopped trailing space in string given to
Trace_IgnoreFunctions() from matching any function name.



06 Aug 1997

Added detection of things like 'LDRB a1, [pc, a1]' when ignoring
instructions which use the pc.


15 Aug 1997

Added Trace_SetUseRMA().


21 Aug 1997

Added detection of ADR instructions when ignoring instructions which use
the pc. Thanks to Robin Watts for this one.

Tue 24 Feb 1998

Added Trace_SetNameProcessor().




And finally
˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜˜

Thanks to Ben Laughton for finding and fixing a couple of bugs in Trace
which stopped it working in module code.

Please feel free to contact me with any queries or suggestions.
