20 Jun 1996

Added code to register with MemCheck when MemCheck_MEMCHECK is defined...


14 Aug 1996

Added #include <stddef.h> to ModMalloc.h

19 Aug 1996

ModMalloc_Realloc now copes with being called with a NULL pointer.


20 Aug 1996

Now uses doubly-linked list. Old style was plain wrong with ModMalloc_Free.


27 Aug 1996

Now uses OS_Module 13 to realloc blocks, rather than simply mallocing
and freeing.


27 Mar 1997

Now checks for freeing of unrecognised blocks. Oops...
Added MemCheck things.
