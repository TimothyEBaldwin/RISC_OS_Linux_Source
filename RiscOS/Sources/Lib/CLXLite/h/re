/*
 * The functions described in this header support the building of a Regular
 * Expression (RE) recognition 'engine' (Non-deterministic Finite state
 * Automaton - NFA) while parsing some concrete representation of the RE.
 * A function 'match' is also provided, which searches a buffer for substrings
 * matching the RE represented by an NFA.
 *
 * The basic paradigm for NFA construction is 2-pass assembly - the expression
 * describing the RE is parsed once to gather information about the size of the
 * corresponding NFA and to check its correctness with respect to abstract-
 * syntactical constraints and implementation limits. If the first pass
 * succeeds then a second pass constructs the NFA (if it fails, the second
 * pass merely repeats the first). In outline:-
 *
 *   REHandle h;
 *   NFA *nfa;
 *   re_begin1(&h);
 *   <calls to re_bra(),re_ket(),re_char(),re_charclass(),re_or(),re_modify()>
 *   re_begin2(&h)
 *   <exactly the same sequence of calls as above>
 *   nfa = re_end(&h);
 *
 * Usually, the sequence of calls made when parsing the source RE are
 * encapsulated in a single function.
 *
 * Dynamically allocated storage can be freed with a single call to free(nfa).
 * The representation used is compact and little storage is used anyway.
 *
 * int re_match(char *buf, int len, NFA *nfa, scanning) returns the index
 * of the first character in [buf, buf+len) to match the pattern described
 * by 'nfa'. No match is signified by returning 'len' (when scanning != 0).
 *
 * re_match can also be used in a constrained mode (scanning == 0) to test
 * whether or not buf matches the specified pattern.
 *
 * CONSTRAINT: the NFA representing a RE may contain at most 254 nodes;
 *             REs bigger than this cannot be handled by this package.
