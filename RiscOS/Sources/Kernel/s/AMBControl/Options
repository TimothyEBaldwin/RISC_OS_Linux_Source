;physical address. Bin entry holds physical address of first page in bin.
;Bin size must be no bigger than minimum physical RAM fragment to be found
;in machine. eg. 512k size gives 128 pages in a bin, so shift of 7 and
;mask of &7F. Max practical bin size is 1M (mask must be immediate constant).

;performance enhancements originally introduced for Ursula OS
;
; ChocolateAMB       - if {FALSE}, disables all AMBControl crazy chocolate flavour enhancements
;
; AMB_LazyMapIn      - if {TRUE}, individual pages of a swapped-in task are only mapped in when
;                      necessary (happens via abort mechanism). This typically makes the swapping
;                      cost much lower and much less sensitive to large slot size. The worst case
;                      swapping cost is still good (abort mechanism cost is very small).
;                      Probably only worth supporting this on ARMs with simple instruction restart
;                      after abort (originally StrongARM revT or later for Ursula)
;
; AMB_LimpidFreePool - if {TRUE}, the cache(s) can be assumed to be clear with respect to the FreePool
;                      when AMBControl fetches pages from it. This allows AMBControl to avoid any
;                      cache clean/flush for moving pages out of the FreePool. This assumption is
;                      valid if either: FreePool pages are uncacheable; or FreePool pages are
;                      never used in situ; or FreePool pages are flushed after use in situ.
;
; AMB_ChocTrace      - if {TRUE}, keep trace info for some enhanced code calls and data (probably development only)
