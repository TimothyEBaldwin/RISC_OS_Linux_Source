This directory contains a modified version of the SoftFloat library, which VFPSupport's support code uses to perform floating point calculations in an IEEE-compliant way.

The bits64 version of SoftFloat Release 2c was used as the basis, obtained from http://www.jhauser.us/arithmetic/SoftFloat.html

The original SoftFloat license text follows

Legal Notice

SoftFloat was written by John R. Hauser.  Release 2c of SoftFloat was made
possible in part by the International Computer Science Institute, located
at Suite 600, 1947 Center Street, Berkeley, California 94704.  Funding
was partially provided by the National Science Foundation under grant
MIP-9311980.  The original version of this code was written as part of a
project to build a fixed-point vector processor in collaboration with the
University of California at Berkeley, overseen by Profs. Nelson Morgan and
John Wawrzynek.
