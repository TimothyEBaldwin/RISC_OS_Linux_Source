; 21-Apr-91 DDV      Changed path variable to allow streams to be opened.
; 21-Apr-91 DDV 0.05 Fixed stack inbalance in 82C710 code which gave branch through zero in certain cases.

; 09-Aug-91 TMD      Changed meaning of DCD,DSR,CTS and RTS lines on 710.
;                    Initialise RTS to on before streams opened, and turn it off when open input stream.
; 13-Aug-91 TMD 0.11 Don't use variable "XONXOFFChar", use variable "SerialXONXOFFChar" instead.
;                    Don't use variable "InputStream", use variable "InputHandle".
;                    Both these were caused by including Hdr:NewSpace, which has these symbols.
; 14-Aug-91 TMD      Put in code to handle SerialOps 3 and 4 (put byte, get byte)
; 16-Aug-91 TMD      Added code to respond to Service_DeviceFSCloseRequest.
; 19-Aug-91 TMD      Added code to update TXI again after modem status IRQ (eg CTS, DSR going low)
; 21-Aug-91 TMD 0.12 Made HeXOFFed me bit (bit 16) read/write
;                    Added NoSplitBaudRates bit (bit 24)
; 22-Aug-91 TMD      Rationalised errors
;                    Put in new split baud rate scheme
;                    Added stand alone messages option
; 02-Sep-91 TMD 0.14 Corrected programming of word length bits, in anticipation of confirmation
;                     from Chips & Technologies that their data sheet was wrong.
;                    Set NewSplitScheme to false, because it breaks vt220.
; 06-Sep-91 TMD 0.15 Changed setbaud710 to return both r1 and r2 the same in old split scheme, rather
;                     than what you asked for. This is so SerialSpt can use the values to set OS_Byte &F2
;                     to the correct value.
; 18-Nov-91 LVR 0.16 Re-written Serial6551 to match '710 driver.
;                    Renamed Serial6551 -> SerialACIA in Init for consistency
;                    Moved OSByte definitions from Serial710 to Init
;                    Fixed Die entry with open streams
;                    Fixed Close entry with handle of 0
;                    If no input or output streams then DTR and RTS are negated
;                    Receipt of char while above threshold sends XOFF for each char received
; 20-Nov-91 LVR 0.17 Added code to init to detect serial sub unit
; 21-Nov-91 LVR 0.18 Delayed negation of DTR after last character transmitted
;                       until Tx dormant.  Prevents last character becoming
;                       stuck in the serialiser.
; 05-Dec-91 TMD 0.19 Put in code to control power for portable machines.
; 03-Feb-92 JSR 0.20 Adjust service call entry for changed Service_MessageFileClosed.
; 06-Mar-92 TMD 0.21 Fix bug RP-1496 (allowing baud rates to be set to 16).
; ---- Released for RISC OS 3.10 ----
; 09-Dec-92 TMD 0.22 Don't reenable IRQs in interrupt code - it causes receiver overrun.
;
; 03-Jun-93 SMC 0.23 Added new baud rates 38400,57600,115200 for new hardware.
;                    Added code for 710/711 lookalike chips with serial FIFOs.
; 28-Jun-93 SMC 0.24 RX timeout interrupt handled even with FIFO threshold==1.
; 29-Jun-93 SMC 0.25 OS_ReadSysInfo 2 can now return 2 for IOMD (treated as IOEB).
; 14-Jul-93 SMC 0.26 OS_ReadSysInfo interface changed again.
; 12-Nov-93 SMC 0.27 Fix bug where non-FIFO machines would have started up with XON/XOFF enabled.
;                    Added support for serialctrl_EnumerateBaud for enumerating available speeds.
;                    Set default serial threshold value to 17.
; 21-Jan-94 SMC 0.28 Clear RX data before setting up combo chip (prevent SMC665 screw up on FIFO enable).
;                    Re-organise TX interrupt so that filling TX FIFO takes lower priority than interrupts.
;                    Fix 710 TX enable bug (write with bit clear before set).
; 09-Feb-94 SMC 0.29 Fix 665 bug where TX irqs stop for no reason (kick TX irq enable every 0.5s).
; 16-Feb-94 SMC 0.30 New TX strategy to keep peripherals which don't have buffer thresholds happy.
; 18-Feb-94 SMC 0.31 Fix register corruption in new TX strategy code.
; 05-May-94 SMC 0.32 Write 2 bytes to FIFO at rates <19200 baud instead of 1 (get round 665
;                       timing screw up).
; 22-Jul-94 RCM 0.33 Call SetPower_Off from close710 (see flag FixPowerSave).
;                    Set OldHardware to false to save ROM space for RO Black.
; 19-Aug-98 WT  0.36 Added PhoebeHardware to change IRQ handling for Phoebe
;                    Added CMOS_BackCompat for back-compatible mode on Phoebe
; 16-Aug-99 KJB 0.37 PhoebeHardware turned off, CMOS_BackCompat set to :LNOT:STB.
;                    Service call table added.
; 20-Aug-99 SNB 0.38 CMOS_BackCompat disabled completely - causes aborts in DeviceFS in Ursula builds
;                    during machine startup.
