; OSS Message file handling code, created for Internationalisation.
; The workspace usage in Percussion is somewhat unconventional, which
; means that I can't easily use the workspace to open the Messages
; file so I open and close it on demand on the stack.


; Lookup a string in the message file, and return a direct pointer to it.
; If file handle (R11) is zero then return zero as looked up string.
; Entry: R0 -> Token
;        R11 -> message file block
; Exit:  R0 -> String or V set error return
