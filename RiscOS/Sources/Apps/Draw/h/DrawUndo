/* -> h.DrawUndo
 *
 * Undo functions in Draw
 *
 * Author:  David Elworthy
 * Version: 0.14
 * History: 0.10 - 17 July 1989 - created
 *          0.11 - 26 July 1989 - rehack undo classes
 *          0.12 -  2 Aug  1989 - state undo made explicit
 *          0.13 -  8 Aug  1989 - major rehack
 *                 10 Aug  1989 - selection changes
 *                 11 Aug  1989 - abolish minor edit concept
 *          0.14 - 22 Aug  1989 - modified and name operations added
 *
 * Version 0.13 introduces higher level undo operations, and introduces 'major
 * edits' as used in the undo code for Edit.
