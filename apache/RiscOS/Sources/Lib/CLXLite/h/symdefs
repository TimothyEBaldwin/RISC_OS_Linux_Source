  Title:        symdefs - operations on symdefs files

/*
 * The following operations on symdefs files are designed to allow two modes
 * of processing: loading an input symbol file; writing an output symbol table
 * with an optional restriction on the symbols output.
 *
 * Operations are carefully chosen to make no assumptions about how storage
 * is managed - this is left entirely to the caller, as storage management
 * is a critical aspect of achieving good performance.
