 * When wild_enumerate finds a match, that match may be a directory. This poses
 * the problem of what to do about the directory if any of the contents of the
 * directory may also match the wildcarding.
 * EG. match xx(*.)* with a dir structure of xx and a file xx.xx, could claim
 * that both xx and xx.xx are matches.
 * a) if there may be a match further down the directory hierarchy then ignore
 *    the intermediate match with a directory (xx.xx only) or
 * b) both the intermediate dir and the leaf be considered a match (xx and xx.xx)
 * To solve this problem, the user may decide which of the two actions is
 * required, and pass the required action into wild_enumerate.
