/* ------------------------- win_register_event_handler --------------------
 * Description:   Install an event handler function for a given window.
 *
 * Parameters:    wimp_w -- the window's handle
 *                win_event_handler -- the event handler function
 *                void *handle -- caller-defined handle 
 * Returns:       void.
 * Other Info:    This call has no effect on the window itself -- it just
 *                informs the win module that the supplied function should
 *                be called when events are delivered to the window.
 *                To remove a handler, call with a null function pointer,
 *                ie.  win_register_event_handler(w,(win_event_handler)0,0)
 *                To catch key events for an icon on the icon bar register
 *                a handler for win_ICONBAR,
 *                   ie. win_event_handler(win_ICONBAR, handler_func, handle)
 *                To catch load event for an icon on the icon bar register
 *                a handler for win_ICONBARLOAD,
 *                 ie. win_event_handler(win_ICONBARLOAD, load_func, handle).

 * Description:   Read current event handler for a given window, and the

 *
 * Parameters:    wimp_w w -- the window's handle
 *                win_event_handler *p -- the handler function
 *                void **handle -- the handle passed to the handler function
 * Returns:       TRUE if given window is registered, FALSE otherwise
 * Other Info:    This is useful for registering an alternative event handler
 *                which can vet events, before passing them on to the original
 *                handler.

 *
 * Parameters:    win_unknown_event_processor -- handler function
 *                void *handle -- passed to handler on call
 * Returns:       void.
 * Other Info:    The win module maintains a list of unknown event handlers.
 *                An unknown event results in the "head of the list" function
 *                being called; if this function doesn't deal with the event
 *                it is passed on to the next in the list, and so on.
 *                Handler functios should return a Boolean result to show
 *                if they dealt with the event, or if it should be passed on.
 *                "Known" events are as follows:
 *                         ENULL, EREDRAW, ECLOSE, EOPEN, EPTRLEAVE,

 *                All other events are considered "unknown"
 *                Note: if none of the unknown event handlers deals with the
 *                event, then it is passed on to the unknown event claiming
 *                window (registered by win_claim_unknown_events()). If 
 *                there is no such claimer, then the unknown event is

 * Returns:       void.
 * Other Info:    Note: event_process() calls exit() on behalf of the program

 *                Programs which wish to remain running even when they have

 *                window can be created from a copy of the template, ie.
