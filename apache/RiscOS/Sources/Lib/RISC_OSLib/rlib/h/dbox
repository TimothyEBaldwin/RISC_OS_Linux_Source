/* ------------------------------ dbox_new ------------------------------
 * Description:   Builds a dialogue box from a named template 
 *                Template editor (FormEd) may have been used to create
 *                this template in the "Templates" file for the application.
 *
 * Parameters:    char *name -- template name (from templates previously
 *                              read in by template_init), from which to
 *                              construct dialogue box. Name is as given
 *                              when using FormEd to create template
 * Returns:       On successful completion, pointer to a dialogue box
 *                structure otherwise null (eg. when not enough space).
 * Other Info:    This only creates a structure. It doesn't display anything!
 *                *However* it does register the dialogue box as an active 
 *                window with the window manager.

 * Description:   Disposes of dialogue box structure.
 *
 * Parameters:    dbox* -- pointer to pointer to a dialogue box structure
 * Returns:       void.
 * Other Info:    This also has the side-efffect of hiding the dialogue box,
 *                so that it no longer appears on the screen. It also
 *                "un-registers" it as an active window with the

 *                        (typically created by dbox_new)
 * Returns:       void.
 * Other Info:    Typically used when dialogue box is from a submenu
 *                so that it disappears when the menu is closed. If called
 *                when dialogue box is showing then no effect. The show will

 *
 * Parameters:    dbox -- dialogue box to be displayed
 *                        (typically created by dbox_new)
 * Returns:       void.
 * Other Info:    typically, not used from menu selection, because it will

 * Other Info:    Note that this does not release any storage. It just
 *                hides the dialogue box. If called when dialogue box  is
 *                already hidden, then no effect.

/* ***************************** dbox Fields. *************************** */

/* A dbox has a number of fields, labelled from 0. There are the following
 * distinct field types:
 *
 * "action" fields. Mouse clicks here are communicated to the client. The 
 * fields are usually labelled "go", "quit", etc. Set/GetField apply to the
 * label on the field, although this is usually set up in the template.
 *
 * "output" fields. These display a message to the user, using SetField.
 *  Mouse clicks etc. have no effect.
 *
 * "input" fields. The user can type into these, and simple local editing is
 * provided. Set/GetField can be used on the textual value, or 
 * Set/GetNumeric if the user should type in numeric values.
 *
 * "on/off" fields. The user can click on these to display their on/off 
 * status. They are always "off" when the dbox is first created. The 
 * template editor can set up mutually exclusive sets of these at will. 
 * Set/GetField apply to the label on this field, Set/GetNumeric 
 * set/get 1 (on) and 0 (off) values.
 *
 */

/* ---------------------- dbox_field / dbox_fieldtype --------------------
 * type dbox_field values are field numbers within a dbox
