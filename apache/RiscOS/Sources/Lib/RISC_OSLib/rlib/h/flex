/* ----------------------------- flex_alloc -------------------------------
 * Description:   Allocates n bytes of store, obtained from the Wimp.
 *
 * Parameters:    flex_ptr anchor -- to be used to access allocated store
 *                int n -- number of bytes to be allocated
 * Returns:       0 == failure, 1 == success
 * Other Info:    You should pass the & of a pointer variable as the first
 *                parameter. The allocated store MUST then be accessed
 *                indirectly, through this, ie. (*anchor)[0] ..(*anchor)[n]
 *                This is important since  the allocated store may later be
 *                moved (it's a shifting heap!!). If there's not enough
 *                store returns zero leaving anchor unchanged.

 *                int at -- location within the allocated store
 *                int by -- extent
 * Returns:       0 == failure, 1 == success
 * Other Info:    If by is +ve, then store is extended, and locations above
 *                "at" are copied up by "by".
 *                If by is -ve, then store is reduced, and any bytes beyond
