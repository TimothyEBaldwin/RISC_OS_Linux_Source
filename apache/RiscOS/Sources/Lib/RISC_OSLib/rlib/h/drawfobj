/* --------------------------- draw_create_diag ----------------------------
 * Description:   Create an empty diagram (ie. just the file header), with
 *                a given bounding box.
 *
 * Parameters:    draw_diag *diag -- pointer to store to hold diagram
 *                char *creator -- pointer to character string holding
 *                                 creator's name
 *                draw_box bbox -- the bounding box (in Draw units).
 * Returns:       void.
 * Other Info:    diag must point at sufficient memory to hold the diagram.
 *                The first 12 chars of creator are stored in the file
 *                header. diag.length is set appropriately by this function.
 *
 */

/* -------------------------- draw_doObjects -------------------------------
 * Description:   Render a specified range of objects from a diagram.
 *
 * Parameters:    draw_diag *diag -- the diagram
 *                draw_object start -- start of range of objects to be
 *                                     rendered
 *                draw_object end   -- end of range of objects to be rendered
 *                draw_redrawstr *r -- WIMP-style redraw rectangle
 *                double scale -- the scale factor for rendering
 *                draw_error *error -- possible error condition.
 * Returns:       TRUE if render was successful.
 * Other Info:    Parameters (except range) are used as in draw_render_diag,
 *                in diagram level module.
 *                The diagram must be verified before a call to this function
 *                If the range of objects inclues text with anti-aliasing
 *                fonts, you MUST call draw_setFontTable first.
 *                Very small (<0.00009) or negative scale factors will cause
 *                run-time errors.

/* -------------------------- draw_setFontTable ----------------------------
 * Description:   Scans a diagram for a font table object and records it for

 *
 * Parameters:    draw_diag *diag -- the diagram to be scanned.
 * Returns:       void.
 * Other Info:    This function must be called for draw_doObjects to work on 
 *                a sequence of objects that includes text objects using
 *                anti-aliasing fonts, but no font table object. The font
 *                table remains valid until either a different one is 
 *                encountered during a call to draw_doObjects, or until
 *                draw_render_diag is called, or until a different diagram

/* -------------------------- draw_verifyObject ----------------------------
 * Description:   Verify the data for an existing object in a diagram
 *
 * Parameters:    draw_diag *diag -- the diagram
 *                draw_object object -- the object to be verified
 *                int *size -- gets set to the amount of memory occupied by
 *                             the object.
 *                draw_error *error -- possible error condition.
 * Returns:       TRUE if object found and verified.
 * Other Info:    Verifying an object ensures that its bounding box is
 *                consistent with the data in it; if not, no error is
 *                reported, but the box is made consistent, On an error, the
 *                location is relative to the start of the diagram.

 *                non-null pointer.

 * Description:   Creates an object after a specified object in a given

 * Parameters:    draw_diag *diag -- the diagram
 *                draw_objectType newObject -- the created object
 *                draw_object after -- the object after which the new object

 *                BOOL rebind -- if TRUE, the bounding box of the diagram is

 *                draw_object *object -- new object's handle
 *                draw_error *error -- possible error condition
 * Returns:       TRUE if object was created OK
 * Other Info:    All data after the insertion point is moved down. "after"
 *                may be set to draw_FirstObject/draw_LastObject for
 *                inserting at the start/end of the diagram.
 *                Diagram must be large enough for the new data; its length
 *                field is updated.
 *                On an error, the location is not meaningful.
 *                The handle of the new object is returned in "object"
 *                If this function is used to create a font table, "after" 
 *                is ignored, and the object merged with the existing one
 *                (if such exists) or inserted at the start of the diagram
 *                otherwise.  This can cause the font reference numbers to
 *                change; if a call to this function is followed by a 
 *                draw_translateText(), the font change will be applied (only
