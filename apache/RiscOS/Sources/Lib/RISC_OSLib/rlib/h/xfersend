 * Other Info:    Note: Your sendproc will be called by functions in the

 *                receipt of wimp_MRAMFETCH messages from the receiving

 *               
 * Other Info:    This is called if the file icon has been dragged onto a

/* ----------------------------- xfersend ----------------------------------
 * Description:   Allows the user to export application data, by icon drag.
 *
 * Parameters:    int filetype -- type of file to save to

 *                int estsize -- estimated size of the file
 *                xfersend_saveproc -- caller-supplied function for saving
 *                                     application data to a file
 *                xfersend_sendproc -- caller-supplied function for in-core
 *                                     data transfer (if application is able
 *                                     to do this)
 *                xfersend_printproc -- caller-supplied function for printing
 *                                      application data, if "icon" is
 *                                      dragged onto printer application
 *                wimp_eventstr *e --  the event which started the export
 *                                     (usually mouse drag)
 *                void *handle -- handle to be passed to handler functions.
 * Returns:       TRUE if data exported successfully.
 * Other Info:    You should typically call this function in a window's
 *                event handler, when you get a "mouse drag" event.
 *                See the "saveas.c" code for an example of this.
 *                xfersend deals with the complexities of message-passing
 *                protocols to achieve the data transfer. Refer to the above
 *                typedefs for an explanation of what the three 
 *                caller-supplied functions should do.
 *                If "name" is 0 then a default name of "Selection" is
 *                supplied.
 *                If you pass 0 as the xfersend_sendproc, then no in-core
 *                data transfer will be attempted
 *                If you pass 0 as the xfersend_printproc, then the file
 *                format for printing is assumed to be the same as for saving
 *                The estimated file size is not essential, but may improve
 *                performance.

/* ----------------------------- xfersend_print ----------------------------
 * Description:   Starts the file transfer protocol to the printer driver

 *
 * Parameters:    int filetype -- type of file to print
 *                char *name -- suggested file name

 *                void *handle -- handle to be passed to handler functions.
 *
 * Returns:       TRUE if data queued successfully.
 *
 * Other Info:    Call this function if you want to print something as the
 *                result of an action of the user. Xfersend_print() deals
 *                with the complexities of message-passing protocols to
 *                achieve the data transfer. There are two possibilities:
 *                (j) The data is queued by the printer manager for later
 *                printing - you will get a Message_PrintTypeOdd when it
 *                wants the printing to be done; or (ij) the printer driver
 *                demands instant printing, or is not loaded: then this
 *                function will call the xfersend_printproc to print the
 *                data immediately. Refer to the above typedefs for an
 *                explanation of what the two caller-supplied functions
 *                should do.
 *                   If "name" is 0 then a default name of "Selection" is
 *                supplied.
 *                   If you pass 0 as the xfersend_sendproc, then no in-core
 *                data transfer will be attempted
 *                   If you psss 0 as the printproc, it is assumed that you
 *                cannot print the file yourself. The printer manager will copy
 *                the file and try to print it using the normal protocol.
 *                   The estimated file size is not essential, but may
 *                improve performance.

 *                request for data from that application (maybe as a result
