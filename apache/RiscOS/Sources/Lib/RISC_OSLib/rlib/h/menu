 * A menu description string defines a sequence of entries, with the
 * following syntax (curly brackets mean 0 or more, square brackets mean
 * 0 or 1):
 *    opt ::= "!" or "~" or ">" or " "
 *    sep ::= "," or "|"
 *    l1 ::= any char but opt or sep
 *    l2 ::= any char but sep
 *    name ::= l1 {l2}
 *    entry ::= {opt} name
 *    descr ::= entry {sep entry}
 * Each entry defines a single entry in the menu. "|" as a separator means
 * that there should be a gap or line between these menu components.
 *
 *   opt ! means, put a tick by it
 *   opt ~ means, make it non-pickable
 *   opt > means, has a dialogue box as "submenu"
 *   space has no effect as an opt.
