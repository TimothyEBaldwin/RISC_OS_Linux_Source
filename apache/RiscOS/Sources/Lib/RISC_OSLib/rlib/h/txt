 * The byte gives the values of the select and extend buttons, 1 for
 * depressed and 0 for not depressed. It gives their previous values,
 * allowing transitions to be detected. It says if the position of the mouse
 * is exactly the same as for the last event, so that multiple clicks may be
 * detected. No assumptions should be made concerning the relationship of
 * these bits to the last mouse event sent to the programmer, as polling
 * delays etc. could cause any combinations to happen. 
 *
 * If txt_EXTRACODE is set then the identity of the event is not defined
 * by this interface. This is used for any expansion. Clients of this
 * interface which receive such events that they do not recognise, should
 * ignore them without reporting an error. 
 *
 * The menu button on the mouse is not transmitted through this interface,
 * but caught elsewhere.
