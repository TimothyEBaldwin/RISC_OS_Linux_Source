/* ------------------------------ dboxfile ---------------------------------
 * Description:   Displays dialogue box with message, input field, and 
 *                OK field and allows input of filename.
 *
 * Parameters:    char *message -- informative message to be displayed
 *                                 in dialogue box
 *                unsigned filetype -- OS-dependent type of file
 *                char *a -- default filename (initially) and also used
 *                           for user-typed filename
 *                int bufsiz -- size of "a"
 * Returns:       void.
 * Other Info:    The template for the dialogue box must be called
 *                "dboxfile_db".  Parameters correspond to the template's
 *                icon numbers as follows:
 *                     icon #0 -- OK button
 *                     icon #1 -- message
 *                     icon #2 -- filename
 *                Template should have the following icons:
 *                     icon #0 -- a text icon containing text "OK"
 *                                with button type "menu icon"
 *                     icon #1 -- an indirected text icon (possibly with
 *                                a default message) with button type
 *                                "never"
 *                     icon #2 -- an indirected text icon with button
 *                                type "writeable".
 *                See the "dboxfile_db" template used by !Edit for an
 *                example.
 *                Message must be of max length 20
 *                The char array pointed to by "a" will contain the typed-in
 *                file name of max length bufsize (if longer, truncated)
