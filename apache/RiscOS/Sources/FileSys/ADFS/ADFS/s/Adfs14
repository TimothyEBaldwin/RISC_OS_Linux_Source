        SUBT    IDE Winchester low level routines -> Adfs14

; Change record
; =============
;
; CDP - Christopher Partington, Cambridge Systems Design
; SBP - Simon Proven
; MJS - Mike Stephens
;
;
; 07-Jan-91  10:00  CDP
; IDE driver started.
;
; 11-Mar-91  16:38  CDP
; TestPresent routine, previously conditioned out, now removed.
; WinIDEWaitNotBusy added as it's needed all over the place.
;
; 13-Mar-91  14:51  CDP
; Fixed incorrect updated of scatter list entry on read error.
;
; 14-Mar-91  13:18  CDP
; Fixed typos in WinClaimIDEIRQs and WinReleaseIDEIRQs (PollPtr
; instead of WinIDEPollPtr - unfortunately, PollPtr is defined
; in the ST506 driver).
;
; 18-Mar-91  18:15  CDP
; Added WinIDEUpdateScatterList routine and calls in IRQHandler.
; (This update is done in more than one place but not between sectors
; of a chunk anymore and therefore not critical timing.)
; Increments WinIDECommandActive when starting a background op and
; decrements it following the background callback.
;
; 20-Mar-91  13:04  CDP
; Added WinIDEPowerSetup and WinIDEKillPowerSetup.
; WinIDEWaitReady changed to take a timeout parameter instead of using
; a fixed value and to return R0,V instead of Z.
;
; 27-Mar-91  10:47  CDP
; WinIDEPowerSetup now checks and clears a flag to determine whether
; it has installed a callback to remove itself. Without this, the
; callback could get added more than once before the first execution
; and this seems to be bad for the machine.
;
; 08-Apr-91  17:22  CDP
; WinIDEStartTransfer now limits the number of sectors to be transferred
; by one IDE op to WinIDEMaxSectorsPerTransfer instead of 256 sectors.
; This is to work around problems with some manufacturers' firmware,
; notably Seagate. It should not affect performance dramatically.
; Code previously conditional on IDEUseRAMCode now made permanent.
; Code to calculate new disc address from drive registers at end of lump
; now made conditional on IDETrustDrive. If this is false, the new disc
; address is calculated from the lump size.
;
; 01-May-91  10:39  CDP
; WinIDEIRQHandler now updates scatter list on write error, using the
; controller's registers (sanity checked) to determine how much was written.
; This was previously not done because there are bugs with some drives in
; this area.
;
; 15-Jul-91  11:57  CDP
; Applied fix suggested by Conner to fix problem with CP3044 (and other
; non-CAM drives?): it is impossible to select a drive that is busy and it
; is impossible to determine whether a drive is busy until is has been
; selected. The combined hardware/software fix, which is especially
; necessary when selecting a slave drive after reset, is to pull up the BUSY
; bit on the bus so that it always reads as 1 when neither drive is driving
; the bus and select drives by repeatedly writing to the drive/head register
; when trying to determine whether the drive is busy (changes to
; WinIDEWaitReady).
;
; 13-Jan-92  11:51  CDP
; Added LockIDEController and UnlockIDEController.
; WinIDEDoBackground: removed controller locking (now handled elsewhere);
; now issues callback to FileCore if nothing to do.
; WinIDECallbackBg: calls UnlockIDEController.
; WinIDECallbackBg now preserves registers so that callers don't need to;
; callers changed.
;
; 14-Jan-92  17:04  CDP
; WinIDECommandDisc changed to wait after selecting drive before testing
; status (similar to WinIDEWaitReady). ANDS in same routine changed to AND
; (there was no point in the S but it did no harm).
;
; 15-Jan-92  13:01  CDP
; WinIDEPowerSetup changed to use Lock/UnlockIDEController.
;
; 02-Apr-92  16:18  CDP
; Changed WinIDECallbackBg to unlock controller *before* calling FileCore
; as FileCore appears to call the low-level entry point from the callback
; routine under certain circumstances.
; WinIDESetDriveAndHead now masks head number to be only bits 0..3 for
; safety (avoids too large head number causing wrong drive to be selected).
;
;
; 23-Aug-1994 SBP
; Changed disc addressing system to support LBA mode when appropriate.
; Not all drives support this, so the WinIDEDriveLBAFlag variable is
; used to determine whether a drive supports LBA or not.  Some commands
; can't use LBA, so there's WinIDESetPhysAddressCHS - which will always
; use CHS addressing.  WinIDESetPhysAddress will choose LBA or CHS
; according to the relevant parameters passed.
;
; 24-Aug-94 SBP
; Modified WinIDEPhysAddrToLogical to support LBA mode.
;
; 06-Sep-1994 SBP
; Added support for BigDisc addressing (sector addresses).
;
; 06-12-94 16:52 SBP
; Fixed WinIDESetPhysAddress when BigDisc turned on.
;
; 08-12-94 11:04 SBP
; Incorporated comments from CDP:
;
; Made SetPhysAddress preserve flags and make choice of
; calling SetPhysAddress or SetPhysAddressCHS use cond.
; BLs instead of branching round code.
;
; Removed unnecessary branch round single instruction, line 1156.
;
; Fixed WinIDEIRQHandler to correctly clear 'in irq' flag on exit.
;
; Conditialised some more instructions to avoid branch.
;
; Removed spurious load of R5 before WinIDEAdjustStatus
;
; 27-02-96 MJS
; StrongARM changes for modifying code
;
