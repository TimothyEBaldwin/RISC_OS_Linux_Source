Search for transition:

     inword = current input word
              32 pixels with the leftmost being least significant

     lowsetbit = inword & -inword
     inword |= lowsetbit-1
     inword = !inword

     lowsetbit = inword & -inword
     inword |= lowsetbit-1
     inword = !inword

     etc. until lowsetbit=0, at which point we get the next word

Unfortunately we need the index of the bit position anyway, so this doesn't
save anything.

If xpath --> chain of current on/off pairs, ascending
   newxcoord[] = array to receive the next set of transitions
   nextx() returns the x-coord of the next x-transition
