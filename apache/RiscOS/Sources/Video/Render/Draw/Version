; Whether edges are clipped in the Y direction by a fast technique, as
; opposed to tracking the edge until it reaches the required Y co-ordinate
; (which can take a long time if the edge starts well above the graphics
; window).

FastYClipping   SETL    {TRUE}

; Whether horizontal or nearly horizontal edges are tracked by a fast
; technique, as opposed to working pixel by pixel. (In particular, this
; can speed up edges that start well to the left or right of the graphics
; window.)
