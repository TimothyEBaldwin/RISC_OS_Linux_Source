; Code fragments used to convert from 1/2/4/8 channels of
; 8-bit mu-law sound in the "logical" buffer, to 2 channels of
; either 16-bit linear sound or 8-bit mu-law sound in the same
; buffer, now treated as a "physical" buffer to be output by DMA.
; Note the complexities caused because the logical buffer may
; be smaller than, the same size as, or bigger than the physical
; buffer, depending on the input and output sample-group sizes.
; There are always the same number of sample-groups in the physical
; buffer as in the logical buffer, and the sample rate is unaltered
; also.
;
; These fragments are compiled dynamically after any sound system
; reconfiguration or stereo position change, to cause the correct
; translation of data after the next sound DMA interrupt.  The compiled
; code lives in module workspace, whereas the conversion table stays
; here in module code space (though it might usefully be copied into
; RAM to maximise access speed if this code is running from ROM).
;
; On call to composite routine
;
;   r12 = start of logical/physical buffer
;   r11 = end of physical buffer (1,2 channels) or
;         start of physical buffer (4,8 channels)
;   r10 = end of logical buffer
;   r9  = base of 256-entry, 512-byte table converting mu-law bytes
;         (treated as 0..255, i.e. unsigned) to 16-bit signed
;         values in the range -3952..+3952.  See below
;         for more details on the format of entries.
;   r8  = 0xFF - mask for extraction of individual mu-law bytes
;   r5  = 0x7FFF - constant used for limit operation if soundgain > 0
;
; during call:
;   r7  = 32-bit accumulator for right channel linear data
;   r6  = 32-bit accumulator for left channel linear data
;   r0, r1, r3 - miscellaneous intermediate values
;   r2, r4, r5 - unused

; Now updated to allow use of LDRSH instead of unaligned LDR's. This required the following changes:
; * Swapping the two halfwords of each convtable entry (although I doubt many people would notice if the waveform was inverted!)
; * Using different shift offsets in stereo_code
;   - In some cases this also resulted in shorter instruction sequences
; * Using different shift offsets in byte_ext_TAB, due to LDRSH not supporting a shift of Rm
;   - r8 was also changed to 0x1fe
; * data_load_TAB was also tweaked to avoid an unaligned LDR for the 2-byte case
;

; Instruction sequence (6): load up linear value for mu-law byte, from
; table.  This always follows the extraction instruction (above) and is
; conditionalised on Z flag from ANDS, to allow faster execution on zero
; byte value (i.e. no load is actually done and r3 stays 0).  N.B.  As
; should be apparent from its definition, The table holds 16-bit values,
; arranged as +ve/-ve pairs, in words.  The access is indexed with LSL #1
; (i.e. 2-byte entries) but is performed as an LDR, so we get both -ve and
; +ve values, with the required one in the top half of r3, because of ARM's
; data rotation on non-word aligned LDRs.  The subsequent stereo position
; code extracts this value using ASR #n where n varies according to the
; required multiplicative factor for the particular stereo position.
; Within the table entries, each value is the basic 12-bit linear value,
; shifted left by 2, and sign-extended to 16-bits.  This leaves the bottom
; two bits 0, so that ASR #18, 17 or 16 then produces the original value
; times 1, 2 or 4 (respectively), sign extended to 32 bits.

; Instruction sequence (7): set or add linear value just loaded, in the
; correct proportions according to stereo position for channel, into stereo
; accumulators.  Some sequences are two instructions, others 3, so we store
; them here as 3 words each (for indexing during compilation) with the 3rd
; one 0 if not required.  The sequences come in pairs, the first of each
; pair being for the first channel, when the accumulators are initialised,
; and the second for subsequent channels, when the accumulators are added
; to.  This saves at least one instruction in the generated code, over
; pre-initialising both accumulators to 0, and more often than not, 2.

; Instruction sequence (8): scaling code, to convert accumulated values
; (32-bit) back into signed 16-bit numbers.  For 8 channels, the maximum
; absolute value in either accumulator is 6*3952*8 = 189696.  To convert
; this into the range 0..32767 requires multiplying by 32767/189696 =
; .1727342...  We approximate this by multiplying by 11/64 = .171875,
; achieved using ADDs/shifts for the *11 and ASR #6 for the /64.  Exactness
; is unimportant, since all the slightly low value introduces is a small
; gain reduction.  For 1, 2 or 4 channels, the maximum value reduces in
; proportion to the number of channels, so the code is the same except for
; the N in ASR #N which is 3,4,5,6 for 1,2,4,8 channels.

; Version 1.52 onwards: supports *soundgain giving 0 to +21dB additional
; gain, with 3dB increments, in mu-law to linear conversion.  This is
; achieved by using a multiplier of *11 and a divisor of 64 (ASR #6) to give
; 0dB for the 8-channel case, with reducing right shifts as channel count
; decreases or gain is increased in 6dB steps.  For the +3dB steps, don't do
; the mul by 11, but divide by 4 (ASR #2) for 8-channel case, to give
; effectively a +3dB increment, and again reduce the right shift constant or
; go to a left shift for reducing channel count or each extra +6dB gain.
