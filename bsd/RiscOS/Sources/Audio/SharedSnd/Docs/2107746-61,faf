<H2> <A NAME="overview"> 1.0 Overview </A> </H2>

<p>The purpose of the SharedSound module is to allow multiple,
distinct, simultaneous software sound generation activities (e.g. a
sound codec under Replay, the software MIDI synthesiser, and a
directly generated sound effect) to all output their individual sounds
in a consistent way, to a single sound output device.  Each source can
have its own volume level and sample rate, with the SharedSound module
maintaining this information on its behalf.  In cooperation with code
in the respective client (source) applications to implement the
low-level operations, the SharedSound module supports the conversion
and mixing of the individual streams of data in the appropriate way,
to produce a final composite output stream to be delivered to the
hardware.  The composite stream can also be processed by further
functions, also registered by clients of the module, to achieve any
overall effects which may be desired.

<H2> <A NAME="technical"> 3.0 Technical background </A> </H2>

<h3>Principles</h3><br>

<p>SharedSound allows multiple sound handlers to output through one
sound output route. SharedSound can potentially provide a number of
useful functions such as mixing, sample rate interpolationand volume
scaling. The initial versions of Shared Sound will simply store the
values requested and insist that the handlers provide these functions.
It may be advantageous for a handler to do its own mixing, volume
scaling and frequency conversion if it is already carrying out such
functions as in the case of the MIDI Synthesiser.  Some mixing is
required by SharedSound, however, to mix the 8 bit source and any
immediate sound handlers with the call back handler buffer data.

<p>In any case values are passed to the Handler fill routine which
indicate the current state of play, in particular the current sample
rate, along with associated values, as well as the current volume
setting. The volume for a handler is calculated from the current
system volume and the volume requested for the handler as well as
scaling depending on the number of currently active handlers. This is
passed as a Left and Right (Stereo) volume as two 16 bit words packed
into a 32 bit word.  A mixer could be provided that reads that name
and current volume of each handler and allows the user to set the
volume of each handler.  

<p>SharedSound will typically sit on top of the current
Sound_LinearHandler.  The register values provided by the
LinearHandler fill call are used as the basis for the parameters
passed by SharedSound to the SharedSound handlers.  In other words the
fill buffer size, initial buffer status and current sample frequency
are all derived from the LinearHandler.  It is perfectly feasible for
the InstallDriver SWI to be implemented so that SharedSound could sit
on other sound output hardware devices, although this may not be the
best way of providing a fully integrated sound system.

<p>Initially, Shared Sound will not offer the sample rate required by
a client handler but will use the rate currently set in the hardware.
If there is only one handler present or active (all other handlers
paused) then it could (in principle) change the system rate to suit
the requests of the single handler; however the current version does
not do this.

<p>As the possession of the Sound_LinearHandler (as with other
handlers) is not in the control of SharedSound it is quite possible
that SharedSound may lose control of the handler.  To cope with this,
SharedSound will check that it is in charge of the handler whenever it
is called via its SWIs, and re-install if it has lost control.  A
specific SWI is provided which will check that SharedSound is still
attached and this can be called by the handler if required.

<p>The call back mechanism is designed to relieve pressure on interrupts
by calling handlers in a state where interrupts can be enabled; to
provide 'look ahead' so that data is available when the system is
busy, to allow the soundDMA activity to overrun without crashing the
computer and to provide overrun information to handlers so that they
can take action to reduce CPU usage.

<h3>Implementation</h3><br>

<p>The current version of SharedSound provides three levels of handler
activity.  The first is an immediate handler.  This is called when
SharedSound is called by the SoundDMA and is therefore required to act
with interrupts disabled and return as quickly as possible.  Such
handlers are likely to be simple 'fill buffer' handlers that do not
require to process any data or a timing device that is using the Sound
interrupt as a timer. 

<p>The second type of handler is a call back handler.  This is called
on a call back and can therefore operate with interrupts enabled and
take more time to execute.  

<p>The third handler type is a process handler.  This is called in the
same way as a call back handler but is called at the end of the call
back process to allow it to add effects or process the current buffer
in some way.  The call back buffer is set to 8 times the current
SoundDMA buffer size and the handlers are called repeatedly to attempt
to keep the call back buffer full.  In other words, if there is
sufficient CPU time then the call back buffer will have 8 buffers
ready for adding to the SoundDMA buffer when called under interrupts.

<p>When a handler is installed with SharedSound it can specify which
sample rate it requires.  SharedSound does not attempt to change the
system rate but it does calculate the fractional stepping value
required by the handler to achieve the rate required.  If the system
rate is changed by another application then SharedSound re-calculates
the values for each handler and passes on both the new sample rate and
the new fractional step to the handler on the next buffer fill.
Similarly, each handler's volume can be changed by an external
application and the current volume is passed on to each handler.

<p>SharedSound is currently used by the the Sound16 codecs/drivers for
Replay, the sound effects system and the MIDI Synthesiser.  All sound
sources can be active at once.

</pre>
<p><STRONG>Type</STRONG>
<p>The handler types are defined as follows:
<pre>        0       Immediate handler
        1       Call back handler
        2       Process handler
</pre>
<p><STRONG>Use</STRONG>

<p>Each handler is called with when the current driver is called if the
handler is an immediate handler or on call back if the handler is
either a call back or process handler.  The handlers in each type are
called in the order in which they were installed.  Process handlers
are called after call back handlers.

<p>Each handler is passed a buffer to fill with the registers set as
follows:

<p><STRONG>On entry</STRONG>
<pre>        R0 =  parameter
        R1 =  base address of buffer to fill
        R2 =  end of buffer

                bit    0   Mix. If set then data must be mixed otherwise overwrite.
                bit    1   Quality. If set then use highest quality e.g. oversampling.
                bits 3-7   0       No overrun

        R4 =  sample frequency
        R5 =  sample period
        R6 =  fractional step as specified by SharedSound_SampleRate
        R7 =  LR volume
</pre>
<p>R4, R5 and R6 are updated at the start of a buffer fill to represent
the current sample frequency etc.  Only bit 0 of the above flags is
implemented by SharedSound.  The other flags are currently used by the
Sound16 drivers.

<p>Not implemented in this version.

<p>This is to set the sample type for the data for a particular handler.
Shared sound can provide a buffer to the handler that is to be filled
in this particular type.  It will return the buffer fill type that it
will be using.  By default this will be Stereo, 16 bit Signed as in
Sound Linear Handler.


<H3>SharedSound_HandlerPause</H3>
<p>Not implemented in this version.

<p>This is to turn a particular handler on or off without having to
de-install it.

<H3>SharedSound_SampleRate</H3>

<p>This SWI is used to set the sample rate used by a particular handler.
Information is returned to indicate whether Shared Sound can provide
this rate and if not what is the nearest rate it can provide. Along
with this is a fractional step value to suggest how the handler can
achieve it's required rate. Sample frequency is always supplied in
1/1024 Hz.

<p><STRONG>On entry</STRONG>
<pre>        R0 = &gt;0  handler number
             =  0 to set the rate for the current output driver

<p>Not implemented in this version.

<p>This sets or reads the mixer values for a driver, where relevant.

<H3>SharedSound_CheckDriver</H3>  

<p>This is used to force SharedSound to make sure that current driver is
still active.  It is needed for situations where another application
has taken control of the Sound Linear handler and note returned
control to SharedSound.
