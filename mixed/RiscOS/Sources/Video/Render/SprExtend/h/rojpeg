/* Given a file image and all necessary workspace, scan the file image,
 * build an array of band pointers into it. file_image points to image_length
 * bytes, which should be a JFIF file. Only two forms of file are accepted - a
 * greyscale single-scan file, and an interlaced YUV (YCbCr) file.
 * 
 * A non-zero error code is returned if an error occurred. Reason code in
 *   cinfo->error_code           (same as returned result)
 *   cinfo->error_argument       (any additional argument)
 * Typical reasons include an unacceptable or badly formed JPEG file.
 *
 * cinfo must point to cinfo->workspace_size bytes of available workspace. This
 * should be about 50K for typical JPEG files, if it's not big enough then
 * cinfo->error_argument is set to what it needs to be - you are welcome to
 * allocate more space and call again.
 * 
 * If the file is at the same address as the previous call, and a sample of the
 * data is the same, then jpeg_scan_file guesses that it's the same data - it's hard to
 * do a random update to the data of a JPEG file.
 * 
 * width and height say how big the resulting image should be - complain if not
 * precisely correct. If double size and band buffer is big enough, interpolate
 * upwards If width==-1 the width test is omitted. If height==-1 the height
 * test is omitted.
 * 
 * (It would be wonderful to feed in scale factors too, so that strange combinations of
 * scaling, interpolation etc. made sensible decisions. Unfortunately this requires the
 * calling code to be prepared to accept an output of an unexpected size, say by a factor
 * of 2 or 8. Not this time.)
 * 
 * Interpolate in the X direction takes twice as much store, and will only be done if
 * it will fit. On return, if it was requested, cinfo->error_argument will have
 * jopt_INTERP_X set if the interpolation is enabled. jopt_OUTBPP_8DITHER and
 * jopt_OUTBPP_8YUV and jopt_OUTBPP_16 are similar, they constitute a request which will
 * only happen if the corresponding bits of cinfo->error_argument are set on exit.
