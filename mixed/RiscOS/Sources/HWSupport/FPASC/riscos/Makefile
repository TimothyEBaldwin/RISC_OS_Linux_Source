# 25-May-94  AMcC     Created.
# 17-Aug-94  AMcC     Removed Specific machine names.
#                     If building for old series machines, comment out A600
#                     target and uncomment ARM2/3 target.
# 28-Jan-97  KJB      If building for a kernel that is capable of operating
#                     in a 32-mode with interrupts enabled, you can change
#                     the APCS to 32bit for a more efficient emulator
